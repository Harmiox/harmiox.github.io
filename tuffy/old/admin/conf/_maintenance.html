Notes for site administrators:

If you're ever stuck in maintenance mode and want to get OUT of it,
rename the /conf/maintenance.html file to /conf/_maintenance.html .

In order to put b2evolution into maintenance mode, rename this file to maintenance.html (with NO _ at the beginning).

In order to put b2evolution into maintenance mode but still allow access to the install script,
rename this file to imaintenance.html (with an i at the beginning).

Edit the contents of this file to change the message that is displayed during maintenance.
