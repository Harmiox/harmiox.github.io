	<h1><code>/cron</code> folder</h1>
	<p>This folder holds the <strong>cron</strong> jobs, i-e: jobs that are typically scheduled to be run on a regular basis (every hour, every day...).</p>
	<p>Currently, you need to refer to your hosting provider in order to set up automatic calls to the jobs inside of this folder.</p>
	<p>You may also use a watchdog service which will ping the files in this folder periodically to achieve the same goal. </p>
	<p><em>Depending on how you set up your cron processor, this folder may or may not need to be accessed through the web.</em> </p>
