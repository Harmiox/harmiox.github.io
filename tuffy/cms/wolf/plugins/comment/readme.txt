== WHAT IT IS ==

The Comments plugin provides you with the functionality to enable visitors to
leave comments on your pages.

Dependencies:
    - Wolf 0.5.5+
    - Statistics API plugin (optional, see NOTES section)

== HOW TO USE IT ==

On each page edition you will have a drop-down available to choose between 3 
options (none, open and close).

 - none:  if you do not want a comment displayed on the page
 - open:  if you want comment and want people to post comment
 - close: if you want to display comment, but do not want people do post other

You will need to add this little code in your layout:

<?php
    if (Plugin::isEnabled('comment'))
    {
        if ($this->comment_status != Comment::NONE)
            $this->includeSnippet('comment-each');
        if ($this->comment_status == Comment::OPEN)
            $this->includeSnippet('comment-form');
    }
?>

== NOTES ==

* When you disable the comment plugin, database table, snippet and
  page.comment_status stay available.

* Do not forget to remove the code you added to your layout if you delete the
  comments plugin from your system. It will do no harm to leave it in, but will
  clutter your layout.

* When the optional statistics_api plugin is enabled, the comments plugin registers
  an event with the statistics_api plugin each time:
    - a comment is added.

* The statistics_api plugin is a plugin by Martijn van der Kleijn and can be
  downloaded from http://www.vanderkleijn.net/wolf-cms/plugins.html
