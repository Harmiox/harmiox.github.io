	<h1><code>/skins_fallback_v5</code> folder</h1>
	<p>This folder holds the <strong>fallback skin templates</strong> for skins using the evoSkin API version 5 (all skins made before b2evolution v6).</p>
	<p><strong>b2evolution Note:</strong> this folder only pertains to the <strong>public interface</strong> skins. The skins for the admin interface are to be found the the <code>/skins_adm</code> folder. </p>
	<p>For example <code>_feedback.php</code> lists the comments and the trackbacks in a standard manner and can then be included in any skin. However, if time permits, the skin designer can also override <code>_feedback.php</code> in his customized skin folder. </p>
